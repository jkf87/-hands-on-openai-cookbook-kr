    "# LangChain으로 도구를 사용하는 에이전트를 구축하는 방법\n",
    "\n",
    "이 노트북에서는 LangChain을 사용하여 외부 도구에 대한 액세스를 통해 OpenAI 모델을 보강하는 방법을 안내합니다. 특히 사용자 지정 도구를 사용하여 사용자 쿼리에 응답하는 LLM 에이전트를 만들 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 랭체인이란 무엇인가요?\n",
    "[랭체인](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)은 언어 모델로 구동되는 애플리케이션을 개발하기 위한 프레임워크입니다. 이 프레임워크를 사용하면 컨텍스트를 인식하고 에이전트로서 환경과 동적으로 상호 작용할 수 있는 계층화된 LLM 기반 애플리케이션을 구축할 수 있으므로 개발자는 코드를 간소화하고 고객은 더욱 역동적인 사용자 경험을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LLM에 툴을 사용해야 하는 이유는 무엇인가요?\n",
    "LLM이 직면하는 가장 일반적인 문제 중 하나는 학습 데이터의 최신성과 구체성이 부족하여 답변이 오래되었을 수 있고, 지식 기반이 매우 다양하기 때문에 착각에 빠지기 쉽다는 점을 극복하는 것입니다. 도구는 기존 지식 기반과 내부 API를 활용하는 통제된 컨텍스트 내에서 LLM이 답변할 수 있도록 하는 훌륭한 방법으로, 엔지니어가 의도한 답변에 도달할 때까지 LLM을 유도하는 대신 동적으로 호출하여 정보를 구문 분석하고 고객에게 제공하는 도구에 대한 액세스를 허용할 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM에게 도구에 대한 액세스 권한을 제공하면 검색 엔진, API 또는 자체 데이터베이스에서 직접 컨텍스트에 맞는 질문에 답변할 수 있습니다. 도구에 대한 액세스 권한이 있는 LLM은 직접 답변하는 대신 중간 단계를 수행하여 관련 정보를 수집할 수 있습니다. 도구를 조합하여 사용할 수도 있습니다. [예를 들어](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/agents/examples/mrkl_chat.html), 검색 도구를 사용하여 정량적 정보를 조회하고 계산기를 사용하여 계산을 실행하도록 언어 모델을 만들 수 있습니다.\n",

    "- LLM 에이전트:** 수정된 버전의 [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) 프레임워크를 활용하여 연쇄 추론을 수행하는 에이전트를 구축합니다.\n",
    "- 히스토리가 있는 LLM 에이전트:** 대화에서 이전 단계에 대한 액세스 권한을 LLM에 제공합니다.\n",
    "- 지식 기반:** 도구를 통해 액세스할 수 있는 \"알아야 할 사항\" 팟캐스트 에피소드의 지식 기반을 생성합니다.\n",
    "- 도구가 있는 LLM 에이전트:** 여러 도구에 대한 액세스 권한으로 에이전트를 확장하고 이를 사용하여 질문에 답하는지 테스트합니다."

Oh, wait, what is balancing a checkbook mean? Seriously? Yeah. Thank God for my wife. So another reason you might avoid a bank is philosophically. There may be a longstanding distrust of banks in your family that you don't want to put your money in, or you may just want to be like, you know what? I don't want to take part in this modern society. I want to kind of drop out a bit. And a really good first move is to shut your bank account down. That's a big statement. Oh, yeah, it is. But a lot of people that are underbanked and don't have accounts aren't there on purpose. It's not some philosophical statement. A lot of times it's simply because they are poor and they don't have a lot of alternatives. Yeah. And the other thing about not having a bank account, not only do you not have a bank account, you also are, like, basically just avoiding banks altogether. There's plenty of other things that banks offer, like loans and mortgage, lollipops, stuff like that. Yeah. Maybe some free nasty coffee. So when you don't have a banking account, that's like the most basic unit of the banking world. Right. If you don't have that, you obviously aren't going to be exposed to all these other things that can help. Things like build your credit history through like a revolving loan or a mortgage or a car loan or something like that that you can build up your credit for and ultimately save money. So when you don't have a bank account, for whatever reason, you are effectively out of the banking system. The problem is you can live parallel to the banking system outside of it, but it can be really dangerous, especially if you're just dealing with cash, because that cash has to stay somewhere, whether it's on you or in your mattress or in a coffee can in your backyard. You're exposed for having that readily available to anybody who finds it or comes into your house with a gun to get it. Yes.\n",

Most cases these days you have well, I don't know about most cases, but in many cases you have automatic deposits of your work checks. Sure. A lot of people pay their bills wirelessly, online, directly from their bank. You might have a student loan, you might have a car loan, you might have your house mortgage, you might pay your credit card bills. All this stuff is running through a bank, most likely. And you would think it's probably impossible to not have a bank account these days. And I would say pretty much all Americans have them. Not true. Well, pretty much all Americans do. Like 93% do. Yeah, but that's not all. No, it's true.\n",

      "Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  Yeah. 7% of Americans do not have bank accounts. About 9 million people last year in 2015 did not have bank accounts. 9 million people is a lot of people. No, it really is. And apparently that's household sorry, not people. Yeah, right. You're that is a big distinction, too. And the FDIC said, man, that's the lowest since we've been tracking this by far. And someone said, well, how long have you been tracking this? They said, well, the last six years. Really? Yeah, which I'm like. Really? That's when they started tracking it, but apparently so 2009. So if you want another number, the 9 million American households don't have bank accounts at all, then there are 25 million households in addition to that. So that makes almost like 34 million households, which that's a substantial number at this point. Sure. The 25 million are what's called underbanked, meaning they may have a bank account, but they don't use the bank account. Yeah. They don't use it because they are probably afraid of overdraft fees. Or they have maybe a bank account that got grandfathered in so that they don't have to pay minimum amount fees. And who knows? There's all sorts of reasons for people to not use a bank account that they have, but probably cheap among them is overdressed, which you'll talk more about. Yeah. And the majority of these underbank people in the United States are poor, usually. A lot of times they're minorities, a lot of times they're less educated. And these communities, there's a few reasons why they may not want to use a bank one. Maybe they don't trust banks. And if you look in the history of the United States or certainly even we're just talking about the Wells Fargo scandal, when you see stuff like that on the news, it should be upsetting to everyone. But obviously if you're poor and you don't have a lot of money, that may scare you into not wanting to use a bank at all. Right? Yeah.\n",

      "Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  Maybe at the time, I might be making it up. I seem to remember them saying that, and I was like, I don't want that. Just let the check bounce and I'll take it up with them. Yes. The way it was marketed, though, was like, hey, we value you. We want to make sure that you can pay all your bills. So if something happens and you're overdrafted we'll cover it. We're just going to charge you a fee. And it sounds good, but again, when you go from high to low and all of a sudden your overdraft fees go from one to four or five or however many, that's a huge problem. Well, and the people that are overdrafting and the people that are at least able to afford those fees. Exactly. So it's a disproportionate burden on the poor, which makes it, as a scam, one of the more evil scams around. Yes. It's just wrong, then the idea that if you open an account, you should not opt in for overdraft protection. And it's easy to say when you're talking about checks for, like you're writing a check for a Mountain Dew and some cheetos. Yeah, who cares if you're short for that? You can go without that. But when you're talking about your rent check or like an actual grocery bill or something like that, it sucks that you can't get that stuff. But it's better to have to put a couple of things back than to pay $35 for one $2 item that you went over by, right? Yeah, that's a good point. And this was in my case, too. This is also back in the day when you I mean, a lot of times it was a mystery how much you had in your account. Right. Like, you couldn't just get on your phone before you write the check and be like, oh, well, no, I don't have enough money to cover this. Yeah, because even if you balanced your checkbook, sometimes you forgot to carry the one, it wasn't always 100% accurate.\n",
